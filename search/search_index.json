In 2024, I've decided to primarily focus on one adventure in one country - Nepal's Mount Everest. The idea flighted into my mind last year when I was discussing the location of Mount Everest with an Engineer at Cisco. Then it came back to me this week with a sudden and definitive calling. </p> <p>I'm going to climb to Mount Everest Base Camp in 2024. I won't share the trekking company or the date I'm going for my safety. However, know that I've done my due diligence to pick a highly safe group to go with. I'm happy to share privately once the excursion is over. </p> <p>So, why am I doing this? Well every so often, I get a satiable need to push myself to an extreme. In 2018, that was going to a coding bootcamp. Now, it's climbing a mountain. I need to test out my physical endurance, and more importantly, my mental endurance. I've practiced decided visualization and faith in achievement, so I know I can achieve this goal. </p> <p>Note that when I say I'm climbing to Mount Everest Base Camp, that's not Summit. Base Camp is 12.5 miles away from Summit, since Summit is on the opposite end of the mountain. Trekking to Base Camp (with the group I've chosen) has a very high percentage of success rate. </p>"},{"location":"im-climbing-to-mount-everest-base-camp/#preparation","title":"Preparation","text":"<p>I'll be sharing my methods of preparation in this blog in the coming year. Please note that I have expert consultants; I will not accept outside advice. </p> <ul> <li>Pick the trek: This is done! I've put down my deposit and I'm all signed up. I picked a time of year to climb that would be conducive to my preference of cold. I found a company with expert sherpas and good accommodations along the way. </li> <li>Create a budget: My Mount Everest Base Camp trek budget includes: international plane tickets, trek fee, Nepal visa, equipment costs, cash to carry, and high elevation insurance. I have a good amount of time to slowly shop for the best equipment that suits my body and needs, so the cost won't hit all at once. In total, I estimate I'll spend about ten thousand dollars for the whole expedition.</li> <li>Buy the equipment: Climbing to Mount Everest Base Camp requires significant equipment (more so if you go to the top). I have a long list of equipment I need to purchase. </li> <li>Physically train: I've started training - weight lifting, running, hiking, and stretching. As the months of training go on, I will be wearing weight on my back during exercise to strengthen myself, and to prep for carrying my day backpack up the mountain. </li> <li>Mentally train: I believe that the most difficult component of the climb will be the mental aspect. Oxygen will be low, I'll be tired and wet, and we'll have many obstacles. My most important task is to remain absolutely certain that I will finish. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"im-climbing-to-mount-everest-base-camp/#preparation-progress","title":"Preparation Progress","text":"<p>So far, I've done quite a bit of research on what I need to bring to accommodate the harsh climate and also my hypermobility.

First off, I would say easily that Classics are the cheapest type of book to read in different formats (paper, digital, audiobook).</p> <p>Here, when I talk about Classics, I\u2019m talking about literature that is reputable. You can find many lists of Classics online through a quick Google search. I also recommend looking for YouTube videos about beginner-friendly Classics. At the end of this article, I\u2019ll share three short Classics I recommend to start with.</p> <p>For anyone looking to challenge themselves and deepen their knowledge and love for the English language, I highly recommend the Classics. These books will make you feel an immense sense of accomplishment when you finish them. They\u2019ll welcome you into worlds that challenge how you live your daily life, and breath new air into the mundane day-to-day.</p> <p>I first reached for the Classics when I was struggling growing up in a very difficult home as a child. I was barred from reading and expressing myself at formative times when I should have been able to form an identity. I broke away and was able to educate myself through my English degree and more importantly, through finding my way to free and cheap Classics.</p> <p>Classics changed the trajectory of my life, and allowed me to form an unbreakable love for books.

It\u2019s a psychological tale that\u2019ll bother you to the core. It\u2019s short and disturbing.</p> </li> <li> <p>The Island of Doctor Moreau by H.G. Wells</p> <p>H.G. Wells is a father of science fiction, and this book is creepy, crawly, and unexpected.

For my first time solo travelling, I knew I could get around Belgium and France with my French. Plus, loads of people in Belgium and France speak some English. </p> <p>Once I'd decided I wanted to travel to Belgium and France, I choose my hubs, or the main cities that I would explore. I stick to cities because they have public transportation and many resources I could need to feel safer. For Belgium and France, I chose Brussels, Brugges, Antwerp, and Paris. However, I stayed only in Brussels. For my first time solo travelling internationally, I wanted to make it really easy on myself since I was nervous about transporting my luggage and the logisitics seemed complicated to me. </p> <p>This year, I'm going to England and Scotland. The language won't be a barrier. I decided on Edinburgh as my main hub, then London and Glasgow. I also opted for day trips to the Highlands and Stonehenge. I'll talk more about day trips in Choose What To Do.</p> <p>Since I'm feeling more confident about solo travelling, I'm packing extra light and moving around a bit more. This means I'll be staying in three cities - Edinburgh, London, and Glasgow. </p> <p>As you see, it's okay to take a trip to really start to get your bearings as a solo traveller and figure out how you want to travel. People travel at different paces. Some people love to stay in one place like I did in Brussels, and others must be constantly moving and seeing as much as possible. I think I'm a bit in the middle.

Then I found an Aparthotel, which was very reasonably priced for the duration of my stay. An Aparthotel is a hybrid between an apartment and a hotel, so it'll have some additional amenities like laundry and a kitchenette. This worked well for me because I wanted to spend most of my days exploring and not eating out too much. So I bought groceries from a local shop and stored them in my kitchenette.</p> <p>I booked all of my nights at Aparthotel Adagio Brussels Grand Place, which was right next door to the underground. This made it really easy for me to get to the main Brussels depot. </p> <p>After I booked my Brussels Apartotel, I knew I wanted to take a day trip to Paris to go to the Louvres, so I booked a round trip train ticket to and from Paris. I also booked a round trip train ticket to Antwerp for another day adventure.</p> <p>For my UK trip this year, I booked a round trip to Edinburgh. Since I decided I would stay in more than Edinburgh, I next chose which cities I wanted to stay in. I booked my Edinburgh, London, and Glasgow hotels. This time, I did not book Aparthotels, since I now feel more comfortable eating out more while travelling.

After that, we moved the starter to underneath the teepee. </p> <p>A fire is absolutely essential to outdoor survival. It's used for heat, cooking, and boiling water. When building a fire, have at least an hour's worth of wood ready to keep the fire going.

That said, it's best to build one with other people. </p> <p>First, we gathered a huge pile of leaves, enough to make a thick mattress that would fit the amount of people in our group (since shelters are best used with two or more people to increase warmth from body heat). </p> <p>The mattress has to be longer than you think, because you'll lose some room from the A frame tapered down design. The mattress is critical as it insulates the ground, and you can stay warmer that way. This is why, when camping, you can feel a significant warmth difference if you sleep in a sleeping bag versus a sleeping bag on top of a sleeping mat. The image below was taken in progress of building a one person shelter, so the leaf pile is smaller than the ones we built in our teams. </p> <p></p> <p>After we made our leaf mattress, we searched for a spine that was longer than the length of our mattress. Then we found two relatively equal length poles to make our A frame. We tied the two similar length poles to each other using paracord. Then we pulled the two tied poles into a large X shape, with a smaller triangle at the top to rest one side of our spine on. </p> <p>We secured the spine with weight and tested the strength of the gravity structure by pulling down on the front (note that the A frame should always be either sitting straight, or leaning toward the spine. If the A frame leans out, there's a higher chance of collapse). </p> <p>Once we completed our A frame structure, we found some straight sticks, and added ribs to each side of the spine by leaning them against the spine. This made up what I call the skeleton of the structure. The image below shows how the shelter looks from the back, which is the opposite of the opening. </p> <p></p> <p>Once we built out the skeleton and knew that it could withstand some weight, we found some crooked branches and pine branches with wide coverage. This served as our next layer, and would be enough to support leaf \"bricks\" without the leaves all falling into the shelter.</p> <p></p> <p>The final step was gathering a huge amount of leaves using a tarp to make \"bricks\". To make the bricks, we gathered a big pile in our hands, packed it in with pressure, and set the brick down, building up row by row until we covered the whole structure.

I wanted to try a Traveler\u2019s Notebook by the Traveler\u2019s Company (not sponsored, just a fan).</p> <p>A Traveler\u2019s Notebook is a smaller leather covered folio that you add inserts to.

If you want to use it daily, consider adding a planner insert. If the journal is meant to be a keepsake, you may opt for an insert that you\u2019ll use for collages or travel memories.</li> <li>How do you currently write? Think about the way you currently write and why you write. Maybe you\u2019re a list keeper.
